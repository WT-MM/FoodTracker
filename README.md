With over 120,000 metric tons of CO2 being produced by food waste and over $1 billion dollars spent every year to manage it in NYC alone, we wanted to create a solution to eliminate food waste as much possible. To do that, we created EcoBeans, an app that lets you take a picture of your groceries, fridge, or pantry, and automatically keep track of their expiration dates. 

By leveraging Google Cloud's Vertex AI Platform, we perform advanced object detection and generative tasks that help the user quickly and cheaply reduce their personal food waste.
